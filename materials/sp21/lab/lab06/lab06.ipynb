Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a pracitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answered correctly.\n",

    "By convention, we often compare the proportion we just calculated to 0.05. If the proportion of simulated statistics greater than or equal to the observed statistic is sufficiently small (less than or equal to 0.05), then this is evidence against Emily's model. Conceptually, you may think of this as the case where less than 5% of simulated values are as far or farther away from what we had expected. If this is not the case, we don’t have any reason to doubt Emily’s model. \n",

    "Therapeutic touch fell out of use after this experiment, which was eventually accepted into one of the premier medical journals. TT practitioners hit back and accused Emily and her family of tampering with the results, while some claimed that Emily's bad spiritual mood towards therapeutic touch made it difficult to read her HEF. Whatever it may be, Emily's experiment is a classic example about how anyone, with the right resources, can test anything they want!"
